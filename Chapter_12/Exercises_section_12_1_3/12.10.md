Explain whether the following call to the ```process``` function defined on page 464 is correct. If not, how hould you correct the call?
```
shared_ptr<int> p(new int(42));
process(shared_ptr<int>(p));
```
The call is correct. In the function ```process```, the parameter ```ptr``` is a copy of the original shared pointer ```p```, which increases the reference count. Before the function scope ends,
```ptr``` is destoryed and the reference count decreased back to the original value. 
Thus, after the function ```process``` is executed, the reference count does not change.
