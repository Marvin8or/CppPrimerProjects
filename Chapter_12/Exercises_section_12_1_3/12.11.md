What would happen if we called ```process``` as follows?
```
process(shared_ptr<int>(p.get()))
```
creates a new shared_ptr that is independent of the original shared_ptr. When this newly created shared_ptr goes out of scope it
frees the memory that was pointing to because its refference count is 1.
