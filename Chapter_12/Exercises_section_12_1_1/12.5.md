We did not make the constructor that takes an ```initializer_list``` ```explicit```, what are the pros and cons of the current implementation?

The pros are:
* We can initialize the class with ```= {...}```
* We can use assignement to assign a list to a ```StrBlob``` object.
* We can pass a initializer list to functions who need ```Strblob``` object.

The cons is:
* The implicit conversion made by the compiler are overlooked. this may cause bugs.
