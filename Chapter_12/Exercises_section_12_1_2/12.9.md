Explain what happens in the following code

'
int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100); //int(42) and int(100) alocated on heap and a pointer q and r are returned to point to that memory
r = q; // r now holds address of q. Now original object to which r was pointing has no pointer so it cannot be freed. (memory leak)
auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), r2 = make_shared<int>(100); // same as before but with shared pointers;
r2 = q2; // no memory leak because refcount of original object of r2 is 0, so it is automatically freed.
