What is a copy constructor? When is it used?

A copy constructor is a constructor where its first parameter is a constant refernece or nonconst reference to the class type. Any additional parameters have default values.
The copy constructor is used implicitly in several situations so it cannot be explicit. If we define a copy constructor the copiler will synthesize one regardeless. The copy constructor 
member wise copies the members of its argument into the object being created.
