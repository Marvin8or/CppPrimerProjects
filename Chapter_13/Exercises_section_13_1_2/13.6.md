What is a copy assignment operator? When is this operator used? What does the synthesized copy assignement do? When is it synthesized?

The copy assignment operator is a an overloaded operator that assignes all the nnonstatic member values of its right hand side to the corresponding member values of the left heand side object using the copy assignment operator.
This operator is used to initialize anew object with the same member values of its right hand side object.
If a class doesn't define a copy assignment operator the compiler synthesizes one. The synthesised copy assignment operator assigns all the nonstatic member values from its right hand side to the
object on its left hand side.
