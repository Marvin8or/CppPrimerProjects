What happens when we assign one ```StrBlob``` to another? What about ```StrBlobPtr```?

If we assign one ```StrBlob``` to another we will copy all the nonstatic member values to the right hand side. The data smart pointer will not copy its underlying data but will both object point to same data. Same for ```StrBlobPtr```.
