Whuch, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?
* a) A class must provide at least one constructor. This statement is untrue because a class does not have to provide any constructors, the compiler will synthetise one if there aren't any present.
* b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list. A constructor with default parameters is also a default constructor.
* c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not provide a default constructor. What does meaningful mean? True, if there are some values that should never be defaultly initialized.
* d) If a class does not provide a default constructor, the compiler generates one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated type. Untrue, only if a class does not define any constructor, the compiler will create a default construcotr thet initializes each memeber to the default value of its associated type.
